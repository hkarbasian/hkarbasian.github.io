My research is about AI-powered design and optimization for large chaotic systems with dominant unpredictability. Specifically, my work lies at the intersection of chaos theory, machine learning and fluid dynamics. I use physics-based machine learning algorithms to develop surrogate models for large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Besides, I work on nonlinear fluid dynamic problems, such as dynamic stall, vortex-induced vibrations, and shape optimization in the presence of turbulent flows. Above all topics, mathematical concepts of nonlinear systems are my interest, where I can find the footprint of chaos in universal laws, modern technologies, and life stories!
