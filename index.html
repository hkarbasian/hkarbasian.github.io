<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">Polytechnique Montreal</a>. My current work is establishing a digital twin framework for industrial applications using deep learning algorithms. I am also actively working on the novel architecture development of neural networks to be able to accelerate large-scale optimizations where conventional numerical solvers fail. Before joining Polytechnique, I was awarded the CQAM Postdoctoral fellowship at <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> to develop reduced-order models for fluids in the Lagrangian system. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~bvermeir">Computational Aerodynamics Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a>. My thesis was about understanding chaotic systems and controlling instability in chaotic optimizations.</p>
<p>My research is about AI-powered design and optimization for large chaotic systems with dominant unpredictability. Specifically, my work lies at the intersection of chaos theory, machine learning and fluid dynamics. I use physics-based machine learning algorithms to develop surrogate models for large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Besides, I work on nonlinear fluid dynamic problems, such as dynamic stall, vortex-induced vibrations, and shape optimization in the presence of turbulent flows. Above all topics, mathematical concepts of nonlinear systems are my interest, where I can find the footprint of chaos in universal laws, modern technologies, and life stories!</p>

						<h3>AI-powered & physics-based simulations</h3><br/>
						<p>At the Fields Institute, my mission was to study complex, large-scale dynamical systems and predict the physical behaviour of these non-linear systems in different scenarios. Unlike conventional methods for solving PDEs in a discrete physical domain (computationally expensive), I employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Koopman formalism to solve PDEs in Hilbert space. My research helps develop robust and efficient solvers for prediction, failure assessment, design and optimization. In other words, I use AI-powered physics-based modelling for turbulence, thermofluid analysis, load prediction, structural/Aeroelasticity analysis, and many other physical phenomena.</p>

						<h3>Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)</h3><br/>
						<p>Solving unsteady sensitivity equations is a challenging problem in large-scale constrained PDE optimization. With the advent of high-fidelity simulations and powerful computational resources, topology optimization struggles from the instability of Navier-Stokes equations. The Idea we are working on is to transfer the optimization framework from a physical 3D space to an unphysical space and solve optimization with lower computational costs with notable improvement in the stability of constrained PDEs. One example is drag minimization for NACA 0012 airfoil at AOA=25 degrees, where the airfoil experiences a massive flow separation. Animation (a) shows the initial case (NACA 0012 airfoil), and animation (b) presents the optimized shape. It is found that the optimization progress is successfully demonstrated with about 20% drag reduction.</p>
