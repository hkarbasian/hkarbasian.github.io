<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">Polytechnique Montreal</a>. My current work is establishing a digital twin framework for industrial applications using deep learning algorithms. I am also actively working on the novel architecture development of neural networks to be able to accelerate large-scale optimizations where conventional numerical solvers fail. Before joining Polytechnique, I was awarded the CQAM Postdoctoral fellowship at <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> to develop reduced-order models for fluids in the Lagrangian system. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~bvermeir">Computational Aerodynamics Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a>. My thesis was about understanding chaotic systems and controlling instability in chaotic optimizations.</p>
<p>My research is about AI-powered design and optimization for large chaotic systems with dominant unpredictability. Specifically, my work lies at the intersection of chaos theory, machine learning and fluid dynamics. I use physics-based machine learning algorithms to develop surrogate models for large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Besides, I work on nonlinear fluid dynamic problems, such as dynamic stall, vortex-induced vibrations, and shape optimization in the presence of turbulent flows. Above all topics, mathematical concepts of nonlinear systems are my interest, where I can find the footprint of chaos in universal laws, modern technologies, and life stories!</p>

<p>I have developed different software to employ them in my research program. I am using an in-house CFD solver for flow analysis. Furthermore, I developed a package for optimization called <a href="http://www.opthinos.com">OPTHiNOS</a> for sensitivity analysis, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and PDE-constrained optimization for highly nonlinear dynamical systems.</p>
