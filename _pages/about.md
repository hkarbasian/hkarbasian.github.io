![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/poly.jpg)

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/). My current work is establishing a digital twin framework for industrial applications using deep learning algorithms. I am also actively working on the novel architecture development of neural networks to be able to accelerate large-scale optimizations where conventional numerical solvers fail. Before joining Polytechnique, I was awarded the CQAM Postdoctoral fellowship at [Fields Institute](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) to develop reduced-order models for fluids in the Lagrangian system. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at [Computational Aerodynamics Lab](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~bvermeir) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). My thesis was about understanding chaotic systems and controlling instability in chaotic optimizations.

My research is about AI-powered design and optimization for large chaotic systems with dominant unpredictability. Specifically, my work lies at the intersection of chaos theory, machine learning and fluid dynamics. I use physics-based machine learning algorithms to develop surrogate models for large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Besides, I work on nonlinear fluid dynamic problems, such as dynamic stall, vortex-induced vibrations, and shape optimization in the presence of turbulent flows. Above all topics, mathematical concepts of nonlinear systems are my interest, where I can find the footprint of chaos in universal laws, modern technologies, and life stories!
